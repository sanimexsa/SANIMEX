# canvas-design

High-level design philosophy for creating memorable and conceptually strong visual interfaces.

## 1. Design Philosophy
- Define the visual "soul" of the project before implementation.
- Deduce the subtle references that make a design feel authentic to its industry (e.g., industrial, luxury, nature).

## 2. Essential Principles
- **Concept Over Decoration**: Every element should serve the core conceptual direction.
- **Grid Innovation**: Use the grid as a guide, but break it intentionally to create focus.
- **Texture & Depth**: Move beyond flat design to create atmospheric interfaces.
